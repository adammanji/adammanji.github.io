        <h2>Understanding and Addressing Islamophobia</h2>
        <p>As we conclude our exploration of Islamophobia in Canada, it is clear that while challenges persist, the resilience and activism of the Muslim community and their allies have led to significant progress. The journey through various facets of society reveals both the depth of the issue and the strides being made towards a more inclusive and understanding Canada.</p>
        <p>From legislative battles like the pushback against Bill 21 to the groundswell of community-led initiatives that foster intercultural dialogue and understanding, the narrative of Muslims in Canada is one of active resistance and hopeful advancement. Success stories, though still emerging, underscore the potential for change and the powerful impact of collective action.</p>
    <br>
        <h2>Final Reflections</h2>
        <p>This project has not only been an academic exploration but also a call to action. It invites us to reflect on our own biases and the societal structures that perpetuate them. As we move forward, let us carry the lessons learned here into our communities and workplaces.</p>
        <p>Islamophobia, like all forms of discrimination, requires a concerted effort to dismantle. The stories and data presented underscore the urgency of this task and the role each of us can play in creating a more equitable society. Let this be a reminder that our actions, however small they may seem, contribute to the larger narrative of our shared humanity.</p>

        <h2>Additional Notes</h2>
        <p>I just wanted to apologize for my lack of engagement with discussions; I had COVID earlier this semester which caused me to miss a few lectures as well. It still does not excuse the absence in discussion. However, I'd like to ask that my lecture attendance be corrected if possible, since it currently reads that I only attend 1 lecture when I submitted more attendance quizzes.</p>
        <p>Additionally, my Reflection Paper 2 shows a missing assignment and I cannot find an email from Canvas that details my submission. I completely understand if it is not possible to receive the credit for this assignment since this is an error on my side, but if the grade can retroactively be changed, please see my Reflection Paper 2 in the "Reflection Papers" tab.</p>
        <p>Thank you, and apologies for the lackluster semester.</p>
